TTT is a simple wrapper library around SFML made to simplify the making of an SFML game.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
{\bfseries{NOTE\+: To build on Windows or mac\+OS, you will need to check the meson documentation by yourself. Maybe I\textquotesingle{}ll consider doing that but that\textquotesingle{}s a project for another day.}}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Like with any project, there will always be some dependencies (no exceptions), this project has them\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SFML (the library that\textquotesingle{}s being wrapped)
\item Meson (the build system)
\item Ninja
\item git
\item A C++ compiler
\item pkg-\/conf
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Actually building}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
4 commands, not much else if you have all of the needed dependencies.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ clone\ https://github.com/reallySmooll/TTT.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ cd\ TTT}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ meson\ setup\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ meson\ compile\ -\/C\ build}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can also do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ sudo\ meson\ install\ -\/C\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ sudo\ mv\ /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/TTT.pc\ /usr/lib/pkgconfig/}

\end{DoxyCode}


The latter commands will install the library system-\/wide so you can use it anywhere without having to keep a {\ttfamily .a} file in your {\ttfamily lib} folder.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Documentation is work in progress but you can already find it at \href{https://reallysmooll.github.io/TTT}{\texttt{ https\+://reallysmooll.\+github.\+io/\+TTT}}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Third party projects used}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
