.SH NAME
md_README \- TTT 
.PP
TTT is a simple wrapper library around SFML made to simplify the making of an SFML game\&.
.SH "Building"
.PP
\fBNOTE: To build on Windows or macOS, you will need to check the meson documentation by yourself\&. Maybe I'll consider doing that but that's a project for another day\&.\fP
.SS "Dependencies"
Like with any project, there will always be some dependencies (no exceptions), this project has them:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
SFML (the library that's being wrapped)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Meson (the build system)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Ninja
.IP "\(bu" 2
git
.IP "\(bu" 2
A C++ compiler
.IP "\(bu" 2
pkg-conf
.PP
.SS "Actually building"
4 commands, not much else if you have all of the needed dependencies\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ git clone https://github\&.com/reallySmooll/TTT\&.git
$ cd TTT
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile \-C build
.fi
.PP
.PP
You can also do:
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ sudo meson install \-C build
$ sudo mv /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/TTT\&.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/
.fi
.PP
.PP
The latter commands will install the library system-wide so you can use it anywhere without having to keep a \fC\&.a\fP file in your \fClib\fP folder\&.
.SH "Usage"
.PP
A basic setup looks something like this (main\&.cpp):
.PP
.PP
.nf
#include <TTT/TTT\&.hpp>

#include <string>

constexpr int WINDOW_WIDTH         = 800;  // You don't have to write it exactly like here\&.
constexpr int WINDOW_HEIGHT        = 600;  // You don't have to write it exactly like here\&.
constexpr std::string WINDOW_TITLE = "TTT" // You don't have to write it exactly like here\&.

int main()
{
    TTT::Window::verbose                      = true; // True or false for debug output\&.
    TTT::Window::toggleFPS                    = true; // True or false for toggling FPS at startup\&.
    TTT::Window::shouldCreateDefaultEventLoop = true; // True or false for creating a default immutable event loop\&.

    TTT::Window ttt(WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, WINDOW_TITLE /* optional */);

    return 0;
}

.SH "Documentation"
.PP
Documentation is work in progress but you can already find it at https://reallysmooll.github.io/TTT-docs\&.
